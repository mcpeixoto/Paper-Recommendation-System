* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
* [Facebook's Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)
* [Sentence Transformers](sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2)
* [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html)
* [ArXiv dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For this project you will need to have installed [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and have a [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/).

This also requires ~20Gb of RAM to run and a GPU is recommended
### Installation

1. Install the dependencies

```sh
make install
```

This will use the `environment.yml` file and conda to create a new environment with all the required dependencies.

2. Download the ArXiv dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv), this can be done by running the following command:

```sh
make download
```


1. Run the following command to create the Faiss index:

```sh
make create_index
```

4. Run the following command to start the Streamlit app:

```sh
make run
```

## Usage

For running the aplicattion, after following the installation steps, run the following command:

```sh
make run
```

If you desire to update the ArXiv dataset and the Faiss index, run the following command:

```sh
make update
```

## Roadmap
